# vision-transformers-tf

This repository contains a non-exhaustive collection of vision transformer models implemented in TensorFlow. Not to confuse with the original Vision Transformers paper [1], the architectures implemented here are generally referred to as Vision Transformers since they make use of Transformers in some way or the other for the vision modality.
